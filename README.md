Command line emoji search.

# Installation

Note: Waiting for a squatter to get off the name before I can publish to pip..

# Usage

    $ emo pray fire
    🙏 🔥

Emo can also copy straight to the clipboard:

    🌴 🔥 ☁

There are also --list and --all arguments if you just want to see what's available.

And that's all it does!
